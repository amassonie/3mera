# ξmera
ξmera (pronounced kee-mera) is a mechanical keyboard focused around easy manufacturing and modularity
The main concept revolves around the keyboard being made of "modules", allowing an easy and seamless switch between multiple keyboard formats (Full-size, TKL, 65%, 50%... maybe more to come ?)
